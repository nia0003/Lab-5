Lab5 Reflection QuestionsReflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducible research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of studyThe documents and code I use now would not stand anywhere close to a reproducibility test. I didn’t make any comments to show what anything was used for or provide any sanity checks to assure it was working. What I’m doing now is much simpler, but I’m sure if I looked through the first capstone, a lot of it I wouldn’t understand why I used a certain command.I think non-reproducible research slows down both computational biology and bioinformatics. If everything was reproducible, it would make it easier to use old code to advance the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. In my field of study, pre-Optometry, reproducible code could help find methods to identify mutations in Genomes. This could help the patient whose suffering if it’s treatable because we could locate the mutation quicker and hopefully be able to edit or treat it.
