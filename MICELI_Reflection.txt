1. I believe my work may stand up to a reproducability test because I make lots of comments on my scripts. I have a tendency to get lost in my script so I made lots of comments. My comments might not make sense to everyone so it might not pass the test with flying color.
2. Non-reproducable research is hurtful to biology because someone could have made a really great discovery using a script and someone else may want to apply it to thier data. But if you script cannot be used on other data its ability to discover things is limited. 
3. My field of study is genetics which heavilt relies on writting scripts to read data. Data in genetics tend to be very very lengthy and almost impossible for humans to sort through but computers can do it in 1 second. Having reproducable scripts like i said above allows the script to be diverse and allow multiple types of data to be used in it.
