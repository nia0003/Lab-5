Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work.
Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? My management of code is rather disorganized as I continue to learn the process of creating scripts. I'm getting in the habit of adding comments to my commands, making each step of the script more understandable to myself and others who observe it. After finishing the second capstone project, I have a better grasp of what it takes to make a code reproducible and the difficulties involved.
How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? Non-reproducicble research detracts from the credibility of a project. If a script analyzing biological data only works on one project, it bring into question its effectiveness and ability to complete what it is intended to do.  
What about in your specific field of study? From my research experience in a virology lab, being able to perform an experiment and achieve the same results is essential. The procedures that I came up with also had to be clearly detailed so it could be used by other labmates, and possible publication. Clear documentation and reproducible research is essential to validity and trustworthiness in the scientific world.
