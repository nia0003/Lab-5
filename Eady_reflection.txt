Lab 5 Reflections 1. I do not think the way that I manage my code and documents would not stand up to a reproducibility test. While I am working on my Capstone Project, I did not think about working on a different fasta file to see if my code still worked and when I tried it, my code did not work for that file, but it worked for the one that I used. 2. I think non-reproducible research affects computational biology and bioinformatics is that other researchers might think their output is correct, but it is not because the script does not work on other files. In my specific field of study, more specifically what I want to do with my life, I think genetic counselors would trust that code and believe the output and discuss it with patients and it could be totally wrong.
