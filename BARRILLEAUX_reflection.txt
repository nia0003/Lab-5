Lab 5 Reflection Questions

Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. 

	Would it stand up to a reproducibility test?
		I think I currently do a pretty good job managing code and documents in an organized, readable way. I do think the reproducibility could be improved by applying protocols/formatting.


	How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics?
		Non-reproducible research negatively affects all fields of science. Specifically in computational biology and bioinformatics, which rely heavily on reproducibility, research without this quality is likely unuseable. 


	What about in your specific field of study?
		Without reproducibility, genetics and genomic research is not consistent and unhelpful. Research lacking reproducibility also haults progress without other scientists being able to use and understand the research.
